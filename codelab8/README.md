# Extra credit- Making a website with Github pages

## Using templates for a quick start
Using a built template can remove alot of the setup process, saveing time for more customization.

 This is built with [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter).

 This is the main document for [configuration](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/), here I will just give you the basics of it.
### Changeing your home page
By default, the home page is set to the about page.

Deleting the index.html file, this will make Github pages use the home.md files.

### Linking social media to the website
1. Open up _congig.yml file
2. Coppy and paste the link to your social in the repsective area

### [Social Sharing Links](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/#social-sharing-links)
